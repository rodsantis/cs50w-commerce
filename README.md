# cs50w-commerce
Project 2 of CS50 Web

This project was really interesting to make, and the page should function in a basic format the same way that the eBay page functions.

Here, I used technologies like Python with the Django framework, SQL using Django's query system, HTML, and CSS, also utilizing the Django templating system.

It was challenging at times but very fun and rewarding. The time I dedicated here (especially when I got stuck) helped me to improve my skills and also to better understand the technologies I was working with.

I created this project using Git extensively. I started by implementing the models and creating a listing page with the main branch, but after that, I soon started creating branches and developing additional features separately, making sure to merge only when everything was functioning as it should. This ensured the main branch was always up and running with the core project.

I used mainly Bootstrap to style my project and some inline CSS for specific HTML tags.

The admin page is working as intended, meaning admins can view, add, edit, and manage any listing, comment, or bid.

This project was really enjoyable and taught me a lot regarding Django queries and database interactions, and I couldn't be happier to have completed it!
